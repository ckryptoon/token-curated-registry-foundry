# Token Curated Registry in Foundry

## About

This repository contains all files you'll need to test and deploy a very basic TCR (Token Curated Registry) in Foundry. I've borrowed most of it from other codebases, made some simple changes and just updated it with features that Solidity version 0.8.0 and above provides, like custom errors for gas efficiency and so on. It's not my idea, I just simplified and updated it, since I really like the idea of TCRs (Token Curated Registries). The credits will, of course, also be mentioned here in this short documentation, where I'll also provide a link to each repository, I made use of. The basic TCR you make from this repository is quite unique and, in fact, infinite in length (or as infinite as a 256 bits unsigned integer can be). I'll not explain what TCRs are in this context, which is all about providing you with the latest and most up-to-date codes on the most basic implementation of a TCR, that you may experiment with yourself. However, I'd strongly encourage you to read about TCRs in general, about alternative use-cases and so on. Links will be provided right here in this documentation!

## Testing

### Codebases I've Modified and Used

The following codebases have been used to create my own up-to-date version of a very simple implementation of a TCR. The final contracts that's been modified by me will both contain and miss some of the contracts from these repositories, and they've been modified in a number of ways, so these links to GitHub repositories is just credit to the original authors.

### The Token Curated Registry Reading List

This Medium article is basically one of the best reading lists on the subject of TCRs. Here you'll find links to articles on TCR development, but also links to TCR-related GitHub repositories and more. You can learn a lot more about TCRs reading this list through, and even learn what you need in order to experiment with your own TCRs for a wide range of new, crazy and innovative use-cases. Just do it!

## Thanks

I thank you for reading this short documentation, and I'll also thank any recommendations for improvement on my codebase. Please, feel free to reach out - for whatever reason! :)
